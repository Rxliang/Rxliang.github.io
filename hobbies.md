## Hiking & Walking in the Wild

<br>Hiking and walking lift my worries, rejuvenate my body, and fill me with the courage to conquer any challenge. There’s nothing quite like the feeling of being immersed in the crisp, fresh air of the mountains—it’s both a reset and an inspiration. And as a bonus, it opens up endless opportunities for me to indulge in my second passion: capturing the beauty of nature through my lens.

<br>There must be **something truly magical** about standing on stage to give a fantastic speech, which considerably lifts my spirits and energizes my entire body. If you desire to master a specific knowledge in depth, just give a prelection. If you can explain to others for complete understanding, you are already an expert. I really enjoy the accomplishment of imparting my knowledge to others, so what I strive for is to be **a student's favorite professor** at the [best universities in my hometown].

## Past Hobbies

I previously enjoyed long-distance running, [vlog making](https://space.bilibili.com/594030035), and computer game developing/playing. However, I have no time to do any of these things recently.

## My Cat

She is my love. Her name is Laki .
