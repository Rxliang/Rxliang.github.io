# Hobbies

## Hiking & Walking in the Wild

<br>Hiking and walking lift my worries, rejuvenate my body, and fill me with the courage to conquer any challenge. There’s nothing quite like the feeling of being immersed in the crisp, fresh air of the mountains—it’s both a reset and an inspiration. And as a bonus, it opens up endless opportunities for me to indulge in my second passion: capturing the beauty of nature through my lens.

## Photography

<br>Photography is more than just a hobby for me—it’s a way to capture the fleeting moments and hidden beauty of the world around us. Whether it’s the tranquility of a misty morning in the mountains or the vibrant details of a sunset, photography allows me to freeze these moments in time and share them with others. It’s my way of seeing the extraordinary in the everyday and preserving it through the lens.

## Reading
Reading and writing are two sides of the same coin for me. Reading opens up worlds of knowledge, imagination, and perspectives, fueling my curiosity and inspiring new ideas. Writing, on the other hand, is my outlet to process those thoughts, express creativity, and craft something uniquely my own. Together, they form a powerful cycle—what I absorb through reading often finds its way into my writing, allowing me to explore concepts more deeply and share my reflections with others.


## My Cat

Meet my little cat, Laki. Dr. Laki, as I like to call her, lost one of her eyes during an experimental stem cell therapy for retina repair—a groundbreaking attempt to help the blind regain their vision. This all happened during her ‘Post-doc’ phase, where she bravely took part in advancing science!
