<br>Salvaging recoverable tissue following an acute spinal cord injury (SCI) remains a challenging aspect of patient care, primarily due to limited therapeutic options and the difficulty in continuously monitoring physiological changes that contribute to deficits[^1]. In response, we have developed a multifunctional ultrasound-based platform, MUSIC, which offers a comprehensive approach to SCI care. This thin and flexible device is designed for placement along the spinal cord following standard decompression surgery, where bone is removed to alleviate pressure as shown in
