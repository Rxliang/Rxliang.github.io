<br>Salvaging recoverable tissue following an acute spinal cord injury (SCI) remains a challenging aspect of patient care, primarily due to limited therapeutic options and the difficulty in continuously monitoring physiological changes that contribute to deficits[^1]. In response to this and paving way towards neural tissue-sparing human computer interface, we have developed a multifunctional ultrasound-based platform, MUSIC, which offers a comprehensive approach to SCI care and multi-modality functional imaging on spinal cord. This thin and flexible device is designed for placement along the spinal cord following standard decompression surgery, where bone is removed to alleviate pressure.
