<br>Salvaging recoverable tissue following an acute spinal cord injury (SCI) remains a challenging aspect of patient care, primarily due to limited therapeutic options and the difficulty in continuously monitoring physiological changes that contribute to deficits[^1]. In response to this and paving way towards neural tissue-sparing human computer interface, we have developed a multifunctional ultrasound-based platform, MUSIC, which offers a comprehensive approach to SCI care and multi-modality functional imaging on spinal cord. This thin and flexible device is designed for placement along the spinal cord following standard decompression surgery, where bone is removed to alleviate pressure.

<br>Imagine harnessing the power of sound waves to precisely target and treat areas of the body without ever making an incision. Focused Ultrasound (FUS) is revolutionizing medicine by offering a non-invasive alternative to surgery—no radiation, fewer complications, and faster recovery. We’ve taken it further with the AMPLITUDE characterization platform [^2], pushing the boundaries of what’s possible. In addition, we’ve pioneered an in vitro neuromodulation platform [^3] and conducted MRI-guided FUS experiments on rats, alongside ultrasound-guided trials on pigs.

## Robot(Computer)-assisted Surgery (Vision Sensing Digital Twins and Augmented Reality (AR))

<br>With the growing adoption of sensors in operating rooms, surgeons are now better equipped to make precise, agile decisions during procedures. This is particularly crucial in neurosurgeries, where the level of accuracy required, especially for neural implants, makes these advanced tools not just beneficial, but essential. The integration of such technology ensures safer outcomes and helps navigate the complexities of modern surgery with greater confidence.
